            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <p>The Salsa Music Archive (SALMA) collects, preserves, and makes accessible significant materials and objects that document the unique role that Bronx composers, musicians, and salseros played in the development of salsa music.
            <br><br>
            SALMA collaborates with the departments of music, Latin American/Latino studies, and Africana studies at Lehman College to promote performances as well as research into salsa's cultural and political history. 
            <br><br>
            SALMA celebrates the music's importance to the diverse Latino community in the borough and makes its collections publicly available.
            <br><br>
            SALMA strives to link scholarship to social action and facilitate international cooperation on music education.

            <h1>Scope of the Collection</h1>
            <p>
                Salsa is a contentious musical term and master musicians debate whether it is distinct from other forms of Afro-Caribbean music. However, in the words of musician and activist Rubén Blades, salsa is "international urban folklore, not of one city, but of all cities in Latin America." Critical innovations have been made in Cuba, Puerto Rico, Panama, and Colombia. New York, and particularly the Bronx, played a special role in the birth of salsa. SALMA centers on salsa music created by composers and musicians in the Bronx from 1960 to 2000.
