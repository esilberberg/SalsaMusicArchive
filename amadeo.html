            <h1>The Miguel Angel Amadeo Collection</h1>
            <img src="media/casa-amadeo.jpg" class="collection-top-image">
           
            <p>This collection was donated by Miguel Angel Amadeo (b. 1934), composer, musician, 
                and owner of <i>Casa Amadeo, antigua Casa Hernández</i> music store at 786 Prospect Avenue 
                (also known as Miguel Angel "Mike" Amadeo Way) in the Bronx. Amadeo is a prolific 
                composer of Puerto Rican music and a celebrated Bronx artist who has received honors 
                from the National Puerto Rican Day Parade, Hostos Community College, and the Bronx Council 
                on the Arts. Though not exclusively a composer of salsa music, he was a force in the 
                music's development and his songs have been interpreted by salsa luminaries such as Celia Cruz, 
                El Gran Combo, Johnny Pacheco, Ray Barretto, Eddie Palmieri, Willie Colon, and Rubén Blades among others.
            </p>
            <p>Amadeo is the son of the composer Alberto Amadeo Rivera. He acquired the music store in 1969 from Victoria and Rafael Hernández, famed Puerto Rican musicians 
                who were based in New York from the 1920s through the 1960s. Part of Amadeo's generous donation includes 
                materials he acquired from the Hernández siblings.
            </p>
            <p>Many of Amadeo's compositions have never been written down. Part of the donation includes music manuscipts Amadeo created in collaboration with the Lehman College department of music.</p>
